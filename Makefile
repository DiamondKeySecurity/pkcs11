# libhal supports two different methods of connecting to the HSM:
#
# * Directly, via the USB serial port (LIBHAL_TARGET = serial), or
#
# * Via a multiplexing daemon which listens on a PF_UNIX socket and
#   can interleave connections from multiple clients onto the single
#   USB serial port (LIBHAL_TARGET = daemon).
#
# Without the daemon, one can only have one PKCS #11 "application" at
# a time.  This is a problem for packages like OpenDNSSEC, which have
# multiple programs which want to be able to talk to the HSM at once,
# so the default is (now) daemon mode.
#
# The original RPC daemon was a C program using a protocol based on
# SOCK_SEQPACKET, which worked on Linux but not on OSX (Apple doesn't
# support SOCK_SEQPACKET).  The current RPC daemon is a Python program
# using SLIP framing over a SOCK_STREAM connection; since we were
# already using SLIP framing on the USB serial port, this is easy.
#
# Conceptually, the daemon is not really part of the conversation
# between libhal and the HSM, it's just a multiplexer.  In the long
# run, the traffic between libhal and the HSM will use some kind of
# secure channel protocol, which we'll probably want to run over a
# SOCK_STREAM connection in any case.
